His father was killed by a landmine in Morocco and one fateful night a stray bullet from a nearby shootout embeds itself in his skull, leaving him on the verge of instantaneous death. Losing his job and his home, Bazil wanders the streets until he meets Slammer, a pardoned convict who introduces him to a band of eccentric junkyard dealers including Calculator, a math expert and statistician, Buster, a record-holder in human cannonball feats, Tiny Pete, an artistic craftsman of automatons, and Elastic Girl, a sassy contortionist. When chance reveals to Bazil the two weapons manufacturers responsible for building the instruments of his destruction, he constructs a complex scheme for revenge that his newfound family is all too happy to help set in motion.",5.278672,/lgilU7TzFXhZWX39iYsEwJFdPKE.jpg,"[{'name': 'France 2 Cinéma', 'id': 83}, {'name': 'France 3 Cinéma', 'id': 591}, {'name': 'Epithète Films', 'id': 7286}, {'name': 'France 3 (FR 3)', 'id': 11244}, {'name': 'Région Ile-de-France', 'id': 11246}, {'name': 'France 2 (FR2)', 'id': 11359}, {'name': 'Orange Cinéma Séries', 'id': 11620}, {'name': 'Tapioca Films', 'id': 12000}, {'name': 'Warner Bros.
