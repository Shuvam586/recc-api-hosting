Yes, John Lennon's first post-Beatles solo album is still a must-own for any rock fan, but decades of punk, metal, and grunge have desensitized our ears somewhat to the naked howls of despair that fill tracks like ""Mother,"" ""Isolation,"" and ""I Found Out."" In addition, ""I don't believe in Beatles,"" the climactic line of ""God,"" doesn't have nearly the resonance as it did around the time of the Fab Four's breakup, when such a sentiment practically bordered on heresy.
