While John questions whether or not to enter into this life, Primo must decide whether to leave it all behind as he vows to become a better husband and father.

Onna banchô, the first movie in the series, takes place in Shinjuku, Tokyo where rivaling youth gangs are constantly trying to one-up each other in toughness. An all-girl gang led by Mei (Meiko Kaji) gets involved in dangerous circles when Mei's boyfriend Michio (Kôji Wada), wants to join a powerful yakuza organization called Seiyu but inadvertently loses the gangsters' money in a fixed boxing match. Of course, Mei's gang is not going to leave him to the gangsters, especially when helped by an enigmatic and independent female biker called Ako (Akiko Wada).",0.430769,/7f8Zz1SWa8xKYsCaoD0wWHNC8Ql.jpg,"[{'name': 'Nikkatsu', 'id': 955}, {'name': 'Hori Production', 'id': 12148}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'JP', 'name': 'Japan'}]",1970-05-02,0.0,81.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'ja', 'name': '日本語'}]",Released,,Stray Cat Rock: Delinquent Girl Boss,False,5.7,9.0
