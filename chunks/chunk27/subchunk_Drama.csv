While Marcel has become famous and Pierre has not, both are happy with their lives. Pierre is happily married to Romaine, a stylish young flapper. However, Marcel meets and falls in love with her, which Marcel little suspects. Romaine carries on her affair with Marcel, even as Pierre falls ill, which she may have deliberately exacerbated with her treatment in order to murder him. Soon Marcel goes on a concert tour, and Romaine abandons Pierre for a romantic tryst. When Marcel returns, Romaine reconsiders the affair, and realizes that she loves both Pierre and Marcel. She decides that she does not want to hurt either her husband or her lover, and as no other solution seems possible, she commits suicide. Three years later, Pierre visits Marcel to seek the truth, and Marcel tells him that no illicit affair occurred, thereby honoring her memory.",0.767496,/2fdP3qy5Qgc6hFa3KUt0v9JKcnw.jpg,"[{'name': 'Films A2', 'id': 875}, {'name': 'MK2 Productions', 'id': 9209}, {'name': 'Centre National de la Cinématographie (CNC)', 'id': 18367}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]",1986-09-03,0.0,112.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'Français'}]",Released,,Mélo,False,6.8,4.0

Discovering talented filmmakers and developing films that fit his conception of the cinema, free and true to life, is precisely his reason for living. Gregoire devotes almost all of his time and energy to his work. Although he spends weekends with his family at their house in the country, even these precious moments are regularly interrupted by demanding directors and concerned investors.

Storm clouds are gathering, and Gregoires realisation that he may have made one gamble too many will trigger a series of events that will change the lives of his family forever.",1.389502,/yfS1DZ3amYdhbNSsObVOKGrJQDr.jpg,"[{'name': 'Lighthouse Pictures', 'id': 6345}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]",2009-12-16,0.0,110.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'Français'}]",Released,A film producer struggles with suicidal despair.,Father of My Children,False,6.8,19.0
