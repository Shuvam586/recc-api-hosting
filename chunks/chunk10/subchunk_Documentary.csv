Pivoting between oil-spotted Chinatown parking lots and jellyfish-filled banquet scenes, the film captures the spirit of nine-man as players not only battle for a championship but fight to preserve a sport that holds so much history.",0.024224,/mvkLc73ROYsEKqBFDd3a4PvVK5g.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2014-04-27,0.0,87.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'zh', 'name': '普通话'}, {'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'iso_639_1': 'cn', 'name': '广州话 / 廣州話'}]",Released,,9-Man,False,0.0,0.0
