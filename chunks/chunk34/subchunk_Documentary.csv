Media experts, including Jeff Cohen (FAIR) Bob McChesney (Free Press), Chellie Pingree (Common Cause), Jeff Chester (Center for Digital Democracy) and David Brock (Media Matters) provide context and guidance for the story of Fox News and its effect on society.  This documentary also reveals the secrets of Former Fox news producers, reporters, bookers and writers who expose what it's like to work for Fox News.  These former Fox employees talk about how they were forced to push a ""right-wing"" point of view or risk their jobs. Some have even chosen to remain anonymous in order to protect their current livelihoods. As one employee said ""There's no sense of integrity as far as having a line that can't be crossed.""",2.782194,/pf909w5e4nmIL3QysbvX0RFWGno.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2004-07-14,0.0,74.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism,False,6.9,21.0
