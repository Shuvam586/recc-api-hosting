The sea holds all the voices of the earth and those that come from outer space. Water receives impetus from the stars and transmits it to living creatures. Water, the longest border in Chile, also holds the secret of two mysterious buttons which were found on its ocean floor. Chile, with its 2,670 miles of coastline and the largest archipelago in the world, presents a supernatural landscape. In it are volcanoes, mountains and glaciers. In it are the voices of the Patagonian Indigenous people, the first English sailors and also those of its political prisoners. Some say that water has memory. This film shows that it also has a voice.",0.881308,/6GAnKeeKMXh8gm5Zudydd3TnBjC.jpg,"[{'name': 'France 3 Cinéma', 'id': 591}, {'name': 'Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)', 'id': 7025}, {'name': 'Ciné+', 'id': 10611}, {'name': 'France Télévisions', 'id': 11795}, {'name': 'Mediapro', 'id': 12010}, {'name': 'Centre National de la Cinématographie (CNC)', 'id': 18367}, {'name': 'Radio Télévision Suisse (RTS)', 'id': 20663}, {'name': 'Atacama Productions', 'id': 75673}, {'name': 'Valdivia Film', 'id': 75674}, {'name': 'Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes', 'id': 75675}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'CL', 'name': 'Chile'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'ES', 'name': 'Spain'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'CH', 'name': 'Switzerland'}]",2015-10-15,0.0,82.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'es', 'name': 'Español'}]",Released,,The Pearl Button,False,6.6,17.0

He offers insights in an endearingly raspy voice about his latest book, 'In Cold Blood', which Capote declares to be part of a new genre, the ""non-fiction novel."" Just as the Maysles brothers' direct cinema classics turn real stories into narratives, Capote's non-fiction novel makes an effort to turn reality into art. In Cold Blood is based on first-hand accounts of an actual murder. The author affectionately discusses his coverage of the subsequent trial and his intriguing relationship with the two young killers. Capote claims it is the spontaneity of life that compels him to portray reality, but it is his own fresh energy and startling sense of humor that keep us intrigued.",0.084996,/jcHSWFG0bj6qzEaDTEsTEFWzuaX.jpg,"[{'name': 'National Educational Television Network', 'id': 36025}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",1966-01-01,0.0,29.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,A Visit with Truman Capote,False,6.3,2.0
