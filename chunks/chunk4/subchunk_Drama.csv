The sisters withdraw into themselves and finish by committing the worst — killing Madame Lancelin and her daughter after six years of service, on the 2 February 1933 in Le Mans.",0.607812,/23sKuH7h2EAFIUi8eDt81GCLCUn.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}]",2000-11-22,0.0,94.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'Français'}]",Released,It wasn't just a crime.
