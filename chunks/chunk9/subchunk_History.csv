But what lies behind the extraordinary appeal of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to generations of adults and children alike? To mark the 150th anniversary of its publication, this film explores the life and imagination of its author, the Reverend Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll. Journalist Martha Kearney delves into the biographies of both Carroll himself and of the young girl, Alice Liddell, who inspired his most famous creation. She discusses the book with a range of experts, biographers and distinguished cultural figures - from actor Richard E Grant to children's author Philip Pullman - and explores with them the mystery of how a retiring, buttoned-up and meticulous mathematics don, who spent almost his entire life within the cloistered confines of Christ Church Oxford, was able to capture the world of childhood in such a captivating way.",0.065665,/cCIRzgF7MqKaENfl4wtOnXykoFU.jpg,"[{'name': 'BBC', 'id': 5996}, {'name': 'swan films', 'id': 80770}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}]",2015-01-31,0.0,59.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,The Secret World of Lewis Carroll,False,0.0,0.0
