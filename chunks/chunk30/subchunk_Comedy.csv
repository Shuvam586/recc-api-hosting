He’s a typical macho. During the day he works his ass off and at night he gets drunk to blow off steam. As a child Remington mercilessly harassed his homosexual neighbor until the man put a curse on him. One day Remington would turn gay. And it seems like the curse is slowly but surely working its magic. Remington is being forced out of a closet he never thought he’d be in. First his body language turns pink, then the way he talks and finally his sexual preference. Poor Remington finds himself entangled in a confusing threesome with his best friend and girlfriend. In the meantime his mother, a police officer, tries to find the perpetrator of a series of murders in the city’s gay and transsexual community. And the victims do not intend to remain under ground. They’re coming out of their coffins, Gloria Gaynor style !",0.673247,/4C0Y9ZSYxWk91T1GxrGqP6jaGaG.jpg,"[{'name': 'Reality Entertainment', 'id': 58596}, {'name': 'Post Manila', 'id': 58597}, {'name': 'Origin8 Media', 'id': 59279}, {'name': 'SQ Film Laboratories', 'id': 59280}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'PH', 'name': 'Philippines'}]",2011-08-31,721651.0,96.0,[],Released,,Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings,False,5.3,5.0
