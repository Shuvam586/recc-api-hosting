Belic spent several years interviewing over 20 people, ranging from leading happiness researchers to a rickshaw driver in Kolkatta, a family living in a ""co-housing community"" in Denmark, a woman who was run over by a truck, a Cajun fisherman, and more.",1.517025,/AnbmAMCWxQTRojQzbyroxakWKGV.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2011-04-09,0.0,75.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,Happy,False,7.1,21.0
