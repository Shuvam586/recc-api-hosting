Sita is abducted by Ravana, the ruler of Lanka. This movie tells the story of Rama and Sita, along-with a biographical account of the director's relationship with her husband. It intersperses events from the Ramayana, light-hearted but knowledgeable discussion of historical background by a trio of Indian shadow puppets, musical interludes voiced with archival tracks by Annette Hanshaw and scenes from the artist's own life. The ancient mythological and modern biographical plot are parallel tales, sharing numerous themes.",1.711226,/hMDmzpI9lhTUAVGyU1ooEFpnjEp.jpg,"[{'name': 'Nina Paley', 'id': 76628}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2008-02-11,0.0,82.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,The Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told,Sita Sings the Blues,False,6.9,25.0
