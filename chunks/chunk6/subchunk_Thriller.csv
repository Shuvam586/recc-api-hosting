The second Helen is in her 30s, has a successful art career with her partner Alex, and is four months pregnant.  One night, something falls out of the sky and explodes over the town. In the aftermath of this event, bizarre and unexplainable things begin to happen.  Many people in the town go missing—Helen’s husband being one of them—and unnatural cloud formations begin appearing in the sky.
