The attempts to get rid of the cat become more comical, and the cat becomes increasingly destructive, until Mr. Johnson resorts to an explosive solution. The result is a twist ending playing on the end of the children's song, with the cat's nine lives bedeviling Mr. Johnson for eternity.""",0.006668,/svWiNWUX39ylBjDaexrk4LxcYUY.jpg,"[{'name': 'National Film Board of Canada', 'id': 10473}, {'name': 'National Film Board of Canada (NFB)', 'id': 17027}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'CA', 'name': 'Canada'}]",1988-06-22,0.0,7.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,The Cat Came Back,False,6.4,14.0
