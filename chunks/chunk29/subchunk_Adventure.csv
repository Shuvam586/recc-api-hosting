Fraught by the death of his father and forced to endure schoolyard bullying each day, Jim manages to carry on, buoyed by his optimistic imagination and fueled by his sense of adventure. The sudden arrival of Captain Johnson, whose small sailboat has been thrown off course by a storm, changes Jim’s life.  The Captain quickly becomes a mentor and friend to Jim, giving him extraordinary lessons in self-reliance and determination. Soon, Jim develops a liberating self-assurance that so deeply touches the Captain that he allows Jim to see evidence that the Captain may be more than meets the eye. Is Captain Johnson the same Charles Johnson who was a pirate there two hundred years ago? The lad goes with him on a literal journey into the past to find out and emerges able to navigate the course of his life.",0.935899,/oyCNDqdCLktVogYmkSeV5E9pH90.jpg,"[{'name': 'Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)', 'id': 12113}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'CA', 'name': 'Canada'}]",2015-01-04,0.0,88.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'sv', 'name': 'svenska'}]",Released,,Pirate's Passage,False,6.0,3.0
