He decides to write a play and collaborates with a fellow reporter (Loretta Young); the results are unexpectedly hilarious, especially when Young shows up at the mansion with a gaggle of boozehound reporters in tow. With snappy, ribald dialogue (allowable in those pre-Hays Code days), Capra keeps the gags flying fast and furious, taking special delight in having Williams's journalist pals rib him endlessly over his kept-man status. Platinum Blonde was a great success at the time of its release during the class-conscious Depression; for better or worse, its star Harlow was identified with the tag ""platinum blonde"" until her untimely death. --Jerry Renshaw",1.974577,/19VBUTCGYcDyQa7FUv42VoBmLpm.jpg,"[{'name': 'Columbia Pictures Corporation', 'id': 441}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",1931-10-31,0.0,90.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,Platinum Blonde,False,6.0,7.0
