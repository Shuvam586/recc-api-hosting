It comprises of ten illustrated and rhymed stories, mostly about children. Each has a clear moral that demonstrates the disastrous consequences of misbehavior in an exaggerated way. Writer/director Fritz Genschow adapted Hoffmann's book to the big screen. He made a career doing such films, he had done Hansel and Gretel and would go on to adapt Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and other family films. Der Struwwelpeter, however, is weirder and darker than the Grimms' tales. They are heavy morality lessons in which children are burned to death, starved to death, or have their thumbs cut off. In Hoffmann's world the punishment usually far outweighs the crime. Genschow provided a happy ending: through the wonders of reverse action children are brought back from their fiery deaths, their thumbs are reattached, and their misdeeds undone through the power of St. Nicholas and some sort of Christmas miracle.

When Bee (Yew) returns to Malaysia for the first time in a decade - she introduces her conservative father Uncle Chuan (Lee) to her happy-go-lucky British fiancé, Benji (Pfeiffer). With Benji's lack of cultural understanding and comprehension of Chinese traditions, Chuan opposes their marriage. Unexpected circumstances ensue, and Chuan reluctantly submits to their union, on the condition that their wedding adheres to Chinese tradition. Part of that tradition is that Chuan must invite all of his childhood friends personally. So the quintessential odd couple, Benji and Chuan, embark on a cross country adventure to deliver the invitations. Despite language barriers and initial hesitation from both parties, the two men come to realize that their priorities are essentially one and the same.",0.497461,/mgUqTQ2H2aA0fKKKmDv9rLECMeI.jpg,"[{'name': 'Astro Shaw', 'id': 19055}, {'name': 'Woohoo Pictures', 'id': 19897}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'MY', 'name': 'Malaysia'}]",2014-01-30,0.0,102.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'cn', 'name': '广州话 / 廣州話'}, {'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'iso_639_1': 'ms', 'name': 'Bahasa melayu'}, {'iso_639_1': 'zh', 'name': '普通话'}]",Released,,The Journey,False,7.7,3.0
