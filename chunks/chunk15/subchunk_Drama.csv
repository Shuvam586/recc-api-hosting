Syn (David Novotný) jde na procházku se svým otcem (Josef Somr)... Syn je zralý čtyřicátník a žije spokojeně se svou přítelkyní. Otci je přes sedmdesát. Je bývalý vědec-biolog. Klasický intelektuál v dobrém slova smyslu. Zdánlivě jediné, co tyto dva muže spojuje, je to, že se jdou jednou za měsíc společně projít Prahou. Nicméně jsou svázáni poutem čtyřiceti let společného života. V brilantně vedeném dialogu se před námi odkrývají dějiny dvacátého století a všechny absurdity s ním spojené. Odhalují se ta nejhlubší místa lidských vztahů. Odtajňují se staré resty, trápení a radosti. Na scéně se objeví Vnuk, o kterém Syn neměl přes dvacet let ani tušení.
