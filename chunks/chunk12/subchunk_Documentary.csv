Johnny Depp guides the visually stunning journey, smashing narrative conventions, moving seamlessly from interview to animation and in the finest Gonzo tradition questions of witness and authenticity are challenged. Steadman's art is for the first time animated, including illustrations from Hunter S Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vagas. Featuring Richard E Grant, Terry Gilliam, Bruce Robinson and with music from Slash, The All American Rejects, Jason Mraz, Crystal Castles, Ed Hardcourt and Beth Orton. A touching and at times funny film about honesty, friendship and the ambition driving an artist. This is a true record of the demise of the 20th Century counterculture and hipster dream with Ralph Steadman the last of the Gonzo visionaries.",2.229266,/nGFCyfc5QSMUpRZqYNe1ZFqBjFh.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2012-10-12,0.0,89.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,For No Good Reason,False,5.8,5.0
